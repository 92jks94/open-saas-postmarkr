## Introduction

Your client signed the tax form digitally, your corporate officer e-signed the annual report, or your finance team secured the lien release. Now what? You're stuck printing stacks of documents because the IRS or state agencies demand a physical, mandatory mail-in submission. Stop wasting employee time and start automating the final, most complex mile of compliance.

## Compliance Explained: The Legal Loophole

The core of this market lies in the IRS's acceptance of non-wet signatures on forms that are ineligible for e-file due to technical complexity or specialization. The IRS permanently integrated electronic signature acceptance into the Internal Revenue Manual (IRM) 10.10.1 in late 2023. This regulation confirms that for complex, paper-only submissions—such as the U.S. Estate Tax Return (Form 706), Application for Change in Accounting Method (Form 3115), and U.S. Gift Tax Return (Form 709) —a wide variety of non-wet signatures are acceptable. 

This includes:
- A scanned image
- A typed name on a signature block
- A signature captured by third-party software

The signature must meet the IRM's five core requirements, including a means to "preserve the integrity of the signed electronic record". This policy allows for printed documents, but still requires the auditable physical package to be submitted via mail. This creates a durable, non-discretionary market for print fulfillment.

## The Pain Point: The Cost of Manual Compliance

The cost of non-compliance is high, but so is the labor cost of compliance. Your staff is spending hours managing manual, multi-part mailings:

- Printing stacks of documents
- Ensuring accurate addressing
- Using the correct postage
- Handling forms containing complex, multi-page attachments

The administrative burden of tax compliance totals an estimated **7.9 billion hours and $546 billion annually** nationwide. Tax professionals, such as CPAs and attorneys, waste significant administrative time having staff print, collate, and securely mail high-stakes returns, such as Form 706, which alone carries an average preparation fee of $1,289. 

These tasks are high-risk, low-value, and steal focus from core business activities.
