   - **Location**: `src/server/healthCheckEndpoint.ts:14-17`
   - **Implementation**: `simpleHealthCheck()` function
   - **Response Time**: < 100ms
   - **Purpose**: Liveness check for load balancers
   - **Checks**: DATABASE_URL, JWT_SECRET presence
   - **Response**: `{ "status": "ok", "timestamp": "..." }`

2. **`GET /health`** ✅
   - **Location**: `src/server/healthCheckEndpoint.ts:36-55`
   - **Implementation**: `performHealthCheck()` function
   - **Response Time**: < 2s
   - **Purpose**: Comprehensive health status
   - **Checks**: 
     - Environment variables (required + optional)
     - External services (Stripe, SendGrid, Lob, AWS, Sentry)
     - API connectivity tests
     - Monitoring alerts
   - **Response**: Full health status object

3. **`GET /health/detailed`** ✅
   - **Location**: `src/server/healthCheckEndpoint.ts:18-35`
   - **Implementation**: `performHealthCheck()` + system metrics
   - **Response Time**: < 2s

4. **`GET /api/webhooks/health`** ✅
   - **Location**: `src/server/lob/webhook.ts:225-259`
   - **Implementation**: `webhookHealthCheck()` function
   - **Response Time**: < 200ms
   - **Purpose**: Webhook system health
   - **Checks**:
     - Total events processed
     - Success/failure rates
     - Error rate calculation
     - Last processed timestamp
   - **Status Logic**:
     - `healthy`: Events processed, error rate < 50%
     - `degraded`: No events processed yet
     - `unhealthy`: Error rate > 50%

5. **`GET /api/webhooks/metrics`** ✅
   - **Location**: `src/server/lob/webhook.ts:264-277`
   - **Implementation**: `webhookMetricsEndpoint()` function

6. **`GET /api/webhooks/events`** ✅
   - **Location**: `src/server/lob/webhook.ts:282-334`
   - **Implementation**: `webhookEventsEndpoint()` function
   - **Response Time**: < 1s
   - **Purpose**: Debug webhook processing
   - **Filters**: lobId, eventType, success status

#### API Route Configuration Verified

**In `main.wasp`** (lines 477-506):
```wasp
api healthCheck {
  fn: import { healthCheckEndpoint } from "@src/server/healthCheckEndpoint",
  httpRoute: (GET, "/health")

  fn: import { webhookHealthCheck } from "@src/server/lob/webhook",
  httpRoute: (GET, "/api/webhooks/health")
}

api webhookMetrics {
  fn: import { webhookMetricsEndpoint } from "@src/server/lob/webhook",
  httpRoute: (GET, "/api/webhooks/metrics")
}

api webhookEvents {
  fn: import { webhookEventsEndpoint } from "@src/server/lob/webhook",

- ✅ Lob webhook monitoring section with:
  - Webhook health check details
  - Webhook metrics endpoint
  - Webhook events debugging
  - Health status logic
- ✅ Alert configuration (3 tiers):

  - **Warning**: 1-hour response (elevated errors 5-25%, slow responses, no events)
  - **Info**: Awareness (high memory >80%, slow webhook processing >1s)
- ✅ Monitoring tools setup:
  - UptimeRobot configuration
  - Grafana dashboard (optional)

## 🔍 Code Quality Review

### Health Check Implementation

**Strengths**:
- ✅ Multiple endpoints for different use cases
- ✅ Comprehensive checks (env vars, services, connectivity)
- ✅ Proper error handling and fallbacks
- ✅ Fast response times for critical checks
- ✅ Security: sensitive values are masked
- ✅ Well-typed with TypeScript interfaces

**Architecture**:
```
healthCheckEndpoint.ts (routes)
    ↓
healthCheck.ts (logic)
    ↓
├── startupValidation.ts (service health)
├── envValidation.ts (environment validation)
├── apiConnectivityTests.ts (API tests)
└── monitoringAlerts.ts (alert status)
```

### Webhook Monitoring Implementation

**Strengths**:
- ✅ In-memory metrics tracking (fast, no DB overhead)
- ✅ Tracks all critical metrics
- ✅ Error rate calculation
- ✅ Processing time tracking
- ✅ Event type breakdown
- ✅ Idempotency handling
- ✅ Signature verification

**Considerations**:
- ⚠️ Metrics reset on server restart (acceptable for monitoring)
- ⚠️ Consider persistent metrics for long-term trends (optional enhancement)

### Configuration Files

**Strengths**:
- ✅ Health checks configured in both server and client
- ✅ Appropriate intervals and timeouts
- ✅ Grace periods for startup
- ✅ Metrics port configured

## 📈 Testing Verification

### Can Be Tested Now (Pre-Deployment)

1. ✅ Run production readiness script:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/production-readiness-check.sh
   ```

2. ✅ Verify Wasp configuration:
   ```bash
   wasp test  # If tests exist
   ```

3. ✅ Validate environment variables locally

### Must Test Post-Deployment

1. Health check endpoints:
   ```bash
   curl https://api.postmarkr.com/health/simple
   curl https://api.postmarkr.com/health | jq
   curl https://api.postmarkr.com/api/webhooks/health | jq
   ```

2. Webhook processing flow (end-to-end)

3. Monitoring alerts (trigger test alerts)
