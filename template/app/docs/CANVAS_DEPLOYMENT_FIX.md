# Canvas Deployment Fix

## Problem

Deployment was failing with the following error:
```
../../../src/file-upload/s3ThumbnailUtils.ts(5,30): error TS2307: Cannot find module 'canvas' or its corresponding type declarations.
```

## Root Cause

The `canvas` package was imported in `src/file-upload/s3ThumbnailUtils.ts` but was **not listed in `package.json`**. This caused TypeScript compilation to fail during the Wasp build process on Fly.io.

## Solution

### Simple Fix (What We Did)

Since this was working before, Wasp's default Docker build configuration already supports the canvas native module. The fix was straightforward:

1. **Added `canvas` to dependencies** in `package.json`:
   ```json
   "canvas": "^2.11.2"
   ```

2. **Added `@types/canvas` to devDependencies** for TypeScript support:
   ```json
   "@types/canvas": "^2.11.0"
   ```

3. **Re-enabled server-side thumbnail generation** in `src/file-upload/operations.ts`:
   - Updated `generateServerSideThumbnail()` to use dynamic import for canvas
   - Added proper error handling
   - Generates simple placeholder thumbnails using canvas API

### Why This Works

- **Wasp handles Docker configuration**: Wasp's build system includes the necessary system dependencies for canvas (Cairo, Pango, etc.) in its default Docker image
- **No custom Dockerfile needed**: Since this was working before, the infrastructure already supports it
- **Dynamic import**: Using `await import('canvas')` allows graceful fallback if canvas isn't available
- **Client-side fallback**: Client-side thumbnail generation (using pdfjs-dist) still works as primary method

## What Changed

### Files Modified

1. **`package.json`**
   - Added `canvas: ^2.11.2` to dependencies
   - Added `@types/canvas: ^2.11.0` to devDependencies

2. **`src/file-upload/operations.ts`**
   - Re-enabled `generateServerSideThumbnail()` function
   - Added dynamic canvas import for resilience
   - Improved error handling

### No Changes Needed

- ✅ No custom Dockerfile required
- ✅ No changes to `fly-server.toml`
- ✅ No Rollup/Vite configuration changes
- ✅ No changes to deployment scripts

## Testing

### Local Development

**Note**: Canvas requires system dependencies (Cairo, Pango, pkg-config) which may not be installed in your local environment. This is fine! 

- ❌ `npm install` may fail locally when trying to compile canvas
- ✅ Client-side thumbnail generation works perfectly in local dev
- ✅ Server-side thumbnail gracefully fails and returns empty string
- ✅ File uploads and PDF processing work normally

### Deployment Testing

To deploy and test:

```bash
# Skip npm install locally if canvas fails - not needed for deployment!

# Deploy to Fly.io - Docker will handle canvas compilation
npm run deploy

# Or use quick deployment
npm run deploy:quick
```

### Expected Results

- ✅ TypeScript compilation succeeds during Docker build
- ✅ Docker build completes successfully (Wasp's image has canvas dependencies)
- ✅ Server-side thumbnail generation works for PDFs in production
- ✅ Client-side thumbnail generation continues to work as primary method

### Why Local Install Fails (But Deployment Works)

**Local**: Your WSL/Mac/Windows environment may not have:
- `pkg-config`
- `pixman-1`
- `cairo` development libraries
- Other system dependencies for native modules

**Production**: Wasp's Docker image (used by Fly.io) includes all these dependencies, so canvas compiles and works correctly during deployment.

## Architecture Notes

### Thumbnail Generation Strategy

1. **Client-side (Primary)**: Uses `pdfjs-dist` in browser
   - Faster user feedback
   - No server load
   - Works in `src/file-upload/pdfThumbnail.ts`

2. **Server-side (Fallback)**: Uses `canvas` in Node.js
   - Generated during PDF metadata processing job
   - Provides thumbnails for files uploaded via API
   - Simple placeholder design (can be enhanced later)

### Why Both?

- Client-side gives instant feedback during upload
- Server-side ensures all files have thumbnails even if client fails
- Graceful degradation if either method fails

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

If you need full PDF rendering for thumbnails (not just placeholders):

1. Consider using `pdf2pic` library (requires Ghostscript)
2. Or use a serverless thumbnail service (AWS Lambda, Cloudinary)
3. Or use Puppeteer for high-quality rendering (larger Docker image)

For now, the simple placeholder + client-side approach works well.

## Deployment Commands

```bash
# Full deployment with checks
npm run deploy

# Quick deployment
npm run deploy:quick

# Check health after deployment
npm run check:health
```

## Troubleshooting

### Local npm install fails with canvas errors

**This is expected and OK!** Your local environment doesn't need canvas to compile. The errors look like:
```
gyp: Call to 'pkg-config pixman-1 --libs' returned exit status 127
/bin/sh: 1: pkg-config: not found
```

**Solution**: Ignore the local install error and proceed with deployment. Wasp's Docker build will handle it.

### If canvas still fails during deployment:

1. **Check Fly.io build logs**: Look for canvas compilation errors in the Docker build output
2. **Verify Wasp version**: This fix works with Wasp 0.18.0+
3. **Check runtime logs**: `flyctl logs --app postmarkr-server-server`
4. **Fallback works**: Server-side thumbnail generation gracefully fails without breaking file uploads

### If you need to install canvas locally (optional):

Only needed if you want to test server-side thumbnail generation locally:

**Ubuntu/WSL**:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential libcairo2-dev libpango1.0-dev libjpeg-dev libgif-dev librsvg2-dev pkg-config
npm install
```

**Mac**:
```bash
brew install pkg-config cairo pango libpng jpeg giflib librsvg
npm install
```

### If you need to disable server-side thumbnails:

Simply revert `generateServerSideThumbnail()` to return an empty string. Client-side thumbnails will continue to work.
