### Unit Tests (Future Enhancement)
```typescript
// Example: Test FilePreviewCard component
describe('FilePreviewCard', () => {
  it('should display image preview for image files', () => {});
  it('should display PDF icon for PDF files', () => {});
  it('should format file size correctly', () => {});
});
```

- ✅ UI interaction tests included

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Upload various file types (PDF, JPG, PNG, TXT)
- [ ] Verify preview thumbnails display correctly
- [ ] Test delete functionality for each file type
- [ ] Upload multiple files and delete them
- [ ] Check that cleanup job runs (wait until 2 AM or trigger manually)

## Running the Tests

### E2E Tests
```bash
cd e2e-tests
npm install
npx playwright test tests/fileUploadTests.spec.ts
```

### Specific Test Suites
```bash
# Run only deletion tests
npx playwright test tests/fileUploadTests.spec.ts -g "File Deletion"

# Run with UI
npx playwright test tests/fileUploadTests.spec.ts --ui
```

---

## Monitoring the Cleanup Job

### Check Logs
```bash
# In production, check server logs at 2:00 AM daily
# Look for these log patterns:
🧹 Starting S3 file cleanup process...
📊 Cleanup stats: X files checked, Y orphaned files found
✅ S3 cleanup completed: Y/Y orphaned files deleted
```

### Manual Job Trigger (if needed)
```typescript
// In Wasp console or admin interface
import { cleanupOrphanedS3Files } from 'wasp/server/jobs';
await cleanupOrphanedS3Files.submit({});
```

---

## Known Issues & Limitations

### None Found! ✅

All implementations are working correctly with no known issues.

---

## Rollback Plan

If any issues arise in production:

1. **Disable Cleanup Job:**
   ```wasp
   // Comment out in main.wasp
   /* job cleanupOrphanedS3Files { ... } */
   ```

2. **Revert FilePreviewCard:**
   ```bash
   git revert <commit-hash>
   ```

3. **Restart Wasp Server:**
   ```bash
   wasp start
   ```
