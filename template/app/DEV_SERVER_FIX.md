# Development Server Connection Issue - FIXED

## Problem Summary

The frontend was unable to connect to the backend server, showing `ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` errors when trying to reach `http://localhost:3001/auth/me`.

## Root Cause

Your `.env.server` file was configured for **production** mode with production URLs:
- `NODE_ENV=production`
- `WASP_WEB_CLIENT_URL=https://postmarkr-server-client.fly.dev`
- `WASP_SERVER_URL=https://postmarkr-server-sever.fly.dev`

This caused the Wasp server to not properly start on `localhost:3001` because it was configured to run in production mode.

## What Was Fixed

I updated your `.env.server` file to use **development** configuration:

```bash
# Development mode (uncommented)
WASP_WEB_CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:3000
WASP_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:3001

# Production mode (commented out)
#NODE_ENV=production
#SENTRY_RELEASE=live
#LOB_ENVIRONMENT=live
#WASP_WEB_CLIENT_URL=https://postmarkr-server-client.fly.dev
#WASP_SERVER_URL=https://postmarkr-server-sever.fly.dev
```

## Next Steps

1. **Restart the Wasp development server:**
   ```bash
   cd /home/nathah/Projects/open-saas-postmarkr/template/app
   wasp start
   ```

2. **Wait for both servers to start:**
   - Frontend (Vite) should be available at: `http://localhost:3000`
   - Backend (Node/Express) should be available at: `http://localhost:3001`

3. **Verify the server is running:**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:3001/health
   ```
   You should see a health check response.

4. **Check the frontend:**
   Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser - the `ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` errors should be gone.

## Other Warnings (Not Critical)

The console also showed these warnings, but they're not critical:
- **Sentry DSN not provided**: This is expected in development. Sentry error tracking is optional.
- **React Router v7 warning**: Just a future compatibility warning, can be ignored for now.
- **Chrome extension errors**: These are from browser extensions and can be ignored.

## For Production Deployment

When you're ready to deploy, remember to:
1. Uncomment the production environment variables in `.env.server`
2. Comment out the development variables
3. Ensure all production secrets are set correctly

## Troubleshooting

If you still see connection issues after restarting:

1. **Check if ports are in use:**
   ```bash
   lsof -i :3000
   lsof -i :3001
   ```

2. **Kill any stray processes:**
   ```bash
   pkill -f wasp
   pkill -f vite
   pkill -f nodemon
   ```

3. **Check the Wasp logs** for any startup errors in the terminal where you ran `wasp start`.

4. **Verify database is running:**
   ```bash
   wasp start db  # If not already running
   ```

## Notes

- Your database (PostgreSQL) is still running in Docker, which is correct.
- All your other environment variables (Stripe, SendGrid, AWS, etc.) are still configured correctly.
- The `.env.client` file is fine and doesn't need changes.
