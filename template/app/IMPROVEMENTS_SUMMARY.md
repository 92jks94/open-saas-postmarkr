# MVP Launch Improvements - Implementation Summary

**Date**: October 2, 2025  
**Status**: ‚úÖ All 9 improvements completed

---

## üéâ What Was Implemented

### ‚úÖ #1 - Added `auth: false` to Webhooks and Health Checks
**Files Modified**: `main.wasp`

**Changes**:
- Added `auth: false` to `paymentsWebhook` (Stripe webhook)
- Added `auth: false` to `lobWebhook` (Lob webhook)  
- Added `auth: false` to all health check endpoints (`/health`, `/health/simple`, `/health/detailed`)
- Added `auth: false` to `webhookHealthCheck` (public monitoring)
- Added `auth: true` to `webhookMetrics` and `webhookEvents` (admin endpoints)

**Impact**: Prevents unnecessary JWT parsing overhead and ensures webhooks work reliably.

---

### ‚úÖ #2 - Added Timeout to File Fetch Operations
**Files Modified**: `src/server/lob/services.ts`

**Changes**:
- Added 30-second timeout to `fetchFileContent()` function
- Implemented `AbortController` for proper timeout handling
- Added specific error handling for timeout scenarios
- Returns HTTP 504 error when file fetch times out

**Impact**: Prevents hung connections and slow Lob submissions when S3 is slow.

---

### ‚úÖ #3 - Moved Lob Submission to Job System
**Files Created**: `src/mail/jobs.ts`  
**Files Modified**: `main.wasp`, `src/payment/stripe/webhook.ts`

**Changes**:
- Created new job `submitPaidMailToLob` in `main.wasp`
- Implemented job handler in `src/mail/jobs.ts` with proper error handling
- Updated Stripe webhook to schedule job instead of calling Lob directly
- Configured job with retries (3 attempts, 60s delay, exponential backoff)

**Impact**: Reliable mail submission with automatic retries; payment confirmation no longer blocks on Lob API.

---

### ‚úÖ #4 - Rate Limited Address Validation
**Files Modified**: 
- `main.wasp` (removed unused API endpoint)
- `src/server/rate-limiting/config.ts` (added rate limit config)
- `src/address-management/operations.ts` (added rate limiting)

**Changes**:
- Removed unused `/api/validate-address` API endpoint
- Added `addressValidation` rate limit config (20 requests/hour)
- Applied rate limiting to existing `validateAddress` action
- Prevents abuse of Lob API for free address validation

**Impact**: Protects against excessive Lob API costs from validation abuse.

---

### ‚úÖ #5 - Added Webhook Error Alerting
**Files Modified**: `src/server/lob/webhook.ts`

**Changes**:
- Added error tracking with consecutive failure counter
- Implemented email alerting after 5 consecutive failures
- Alerts include error rate, event counts, and latest error message
- Resets counter after sending alert to prevent spam
- Counter resets on successful webhook processing

**Impact**: Immediate notification of webhook issues in production.

---

### ‚úÖ #6 - Secured Admin Webhook Endpoints
**Files Modified**: `src/server/lob/webhook.ts`, `main.wasp`

**Changes**:
- Added admin authentication check to `webhookMetricsEndpoint`
- Added admin authentication check to `webhookEventsEndpoint`
- Returns HTTP 403 for non-admin users
- Set `auth: true` in `main.wasp` for these endpoints

**Impact**: Prevents unauthorized access to sensitive webhook data.

---

### ‚úÖ #7 - Added Pagination to Webhook Events
**Files Modified**: `src/server/lob/webhook.ts`

**Changes**:
- Implemented proper pagination with `skip` and `take`
- Added total count query for pagination metadata
- Max 100 items per page with validation
- Returns comprehensive pagination info (total, limit, offset, hasMore, currentPage, totalPages)

**Impact**: Better performance when viewing webhook event history.

---

### ‚úÖ #8 - Added Circuit Breaker to Stripe
**Files Modified**: `src/payment/stripe/stripeClient.ts`

**Changes**:
- Implemented `StripeCircuitBreaker` class
- Wraps Stripe client with Proxy for automatic circuit breaking
- Opens circuit after 5 failures, resets after 1 minute
- Exports both `stripe` (original) and `safeStripe` (protected) clients
- Logs circuit breaker state changes

**Impact**: Prevents cascading failures when Stripe has issues.

---

### ‚úÖ #9 - Persisted Webhook Metrics to Database
**Files Created/Modified**:
- `schema.prisma` (added `WebhookMetrics` model)
- `main.wasp` (added `WebhookMetrics` entity to endpoints)
- `src/server/lob/webhook.ts` (persistence logic)

**Changes**:
- Added `WebhookMetrics` Prisma model with all metric fields
- Implemented `persistWebhookMetrics()` function
- Metrics persist every 10 events automatically
- Updated metrics endpoint to return both in-memory and persisted data
- Indexed by source and updatedAt for efficient queries

**Impact**: Metrics survive server restarts; historical webhook data available.

---

## üöÄ Next Steps

### 1. Run Database Migration
```bash
wasp db migrate-dev "Add webhook metrics persistence"
```

This creates the new `WebhookMetrics` table in your database.

### 2. Restart Wasp Development Server
```bash
wasp start
```

Wasp needs to regenerate code based on:
- New Prisma model (`WebhookMetrics`)
- New job definition (`submitPaidMailToLob`)
- Updated entity dependencies

### 3. Set Admin Alert Email (Optional)
Add to `.env.server`:
```bash
ADMIN_ALERT_EMAIL=your-email@postmarkr.com
```

If not set, alerts default to `nathan@postmarkr.com`.

### 4. Test Key Features
- **Job System**: Create a mail piece, complete payment, verify job runs
- **Webhook Alerting**: Trigger 5 consecutive webhook failures (test mode)
- **Circuit Breaker**: Monitor logs for circuit breaker state changes
- **Pagination**: Test `/api/webhooks/events?limit=10&offset=0`

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Authentication Changes
- Webhooks are now explicitly public (`auth: false`)
- Admin endpoints require authentication and admin role
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

### Job System
- Requires PostgreSQL (PgBoss executor)
- Jobs are tracked in `pgboss` schema tables
- Failed jobs automatically retry with exponential backoff

### Circuit Breakers
- Stripe circuit breaker tracks failures per server instance
- Opens after 5 consecutive failures
- Auto-resets after 1 minute of no requests

### Metrics Persistence
- Metrics persist every 10 webhook events
- Upserts existing record (one record per source)
- Doesn't affect webhook processing on failure
